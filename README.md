<h3 align="center">💀 My vision of RPG in Minecraft 💀</h3>

❔ The mod is created with the goal of adding **RPG mechanics** to the game. What I mean by this is:

- 🔵 Passive/active skill tree ✨
- 🔵 RPG classes, combat/craft 🔨
- 🔵 Weapons, armor, magic 🏹
- 🔵 Mobs and bosses 🎃
- 🔵 New structures and buildings 🧱
  
🔮So far, no one has created a modification that turns Minecraft into an RPG, except for RobertSkalko, the creator of Mine and Slash _(https://github.com/RobertSkalko/Mine-And-Slash-Rework)_. But he was inspired by the game Diablo, if I'm not mistaken. My inspirations are the game **The Witcher 3** and **The Elder Scrolls**. I also drew inspiration from the manga **Berserk**.

😲 I will strive to create my own lore for my mod and exclude vanilla mechanics as much as possible, as I consider them a little childish and too simple.

🤡 My daily life is filled with activities, the speed of development is unlikely to be outstanding, but I plan to do this regularly, as I enjoy this creativity. And I’ve had this idea for a long time, since about 2020. It's time to make my dream come true.


😊 Thank you for your attention!  _Epilekt_ 💩
