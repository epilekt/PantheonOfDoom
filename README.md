<h3 align="center">💀 My vision of an RPG in Minecraft 💀</h3>


❔ The mod is created with the goal of adding RPG mechanics to the game. What I mean by this is:

🔵 Passive/active skill tree ✨
🔵 RPG classes, combat/craft 🔨
🔵 Weapons, armor, magic 🏹
🔵 Mobs and bosses 🎃
🔵 New structures and buildings 🧱
  
🔮So far, no one has created a modification that turns Minecraft into an RPG, except for Robert Skalko, the creator of Mine and Slash. But he was inspired by the game Diablo, if I'm not mistaken. My inspirations are the game The Witcher 3 and the Elder Scrolls series of games. I also drew inspiration from the manga Berserk.

😲 I will strive to create my own lore for my mod and exclude vanilla mechanics as much as possible, as I consider them a little childish and too simple.

🤡 My daily life is filled with activities, the speed of development is unlikely to be outstanding, but I plan to do this regularly, as I enjoy this creativity. And I’ve had this idea for a long time, since about 2020. It's time to make your dream come true.


😊 Thank you for your attention!
